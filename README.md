# Zero Trust

The microservices architecture and the popularization of cloud service providers have introduced cybersecurity challenges. Dynamic network perimeters, expanded attack surfaces, and complex communications invalidate traditional models based on static perimeters.  

This repository presents two access control approaches as starting points for adopting Zero Trust:

- [Policy Engine with Open Policy Agent (OPA)](./policy-engine/README.md): one based on a policy engine with multifactor quotas;

- [Log Engine with OpenSearch](./logs-engine/README.md): based on log analysis and alerts to define penalties.

The proposed systems were evaluated based on access decisions in simulated environments. The tests values and assets are present in this repository [here](./tests/)
